class GradManager:
    r"""GradManager computes gradients or more generally, vector-Jacobian product, by reverse mode
    automatic differentiation (a.k.a. back propagation).

    Reverse mode autodiff normally reuses many intermediate tensors for best computation efficiency.
    In a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) environment however, it is impossible to known how the user
    would take gradients later thus which tensors to keep. To solve this problem, the user must
    somehow declare beforehand which gradient could possibly be taken. With GradManager, users are
    required to call the :meth:`attach` method on a tensor if they want to take gradients with
    respect to it later. Furthermore, any computation on a tensor before it is attached is
    completely ignored from the autodiff perspective, so :meth:`attach` must be called before any
    computation that needs differentiation.

    For example, the following symbolic differentiation code

    .. code-block::

        x = get_x()
        y = f(x)
        dy = ones_like(y)
        dx = vjp(y, x, dy) # vector-Jacobian product

    can be rewriten using GradManager for REPL environment as

    .. code-block::

        with GradManager() as gm:
            x = get_x()
            gm.attach(x) # must be placed before any computation on x that needs differentiation
            y = f(x)
            dy = ones_like(y)
            gm.backward(y, dy) # doesn't need x, already known via attach()
            dx = x.grad # backward() saves result to .grad attribute

    A more realistic example of training a neural network would be like

    .. code-block::

        gm = GradManager()
        gm.attach(model.parameters())

        for data in dataset:
            with gm:
                loss = model(data)
                gm.backward(loss)
            # gradients w.r.t. parameters is accumulated into their .grad attributes

    You can also use ``record()`` and ``release()`` method instead of ``with`` context:

    .. code-block::

        gm = GradManager()
        gm.attach(model.parameters())

        for data in dataset:
            gm.record()
            loss = model(data)
            gm.backward(loss)
            # backward() will clear recorded history and free resources
            # call release() if backward() is not called
            # gm.release()

    For your convenience, GradManager may (not must) be reused. As shown in the examples, you
    only need to attach a tensor once and GradManager will remember it afterwards.
    However, a single GradManager can record only one computation history at a time. To run
    multiple differentiations simultaneously or perform high order differentiation, create
    as many GradManager as you need.

    .. note::

        Mutable tensors introduce ambiguities when doing symbolic differentiation: which version
        of the tensor are we referring to? For attached tensors, GradManager resolves this
        ambiguity by "snapshoting" them on first encounter, either on :meth:`record` (or entering
        with statement) if tensor is attached before :meth:`record`, or on :meth:`attach` if
        GradManager is already recording. Attached tensors will then be interpreted as their
        snapshotted version for differentiation purpose. The same ambiguity on the first parameter
        of :meth:`backward` is simply resolved by using the latest version.

    Typically, in data parallel, we would like to average the gradients across
    processes. Users will finally get the averaged gradients if an "AllReduce"
    callback is registered as follows:

    .. code-block::

        import megengine.distributed as dist

        gm = GradManager()
        gm.attach(model.parameters(), callback=dist.make_allreduce_cb("MEAN"))
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._attach_specs = {}  # id(Tensor) -> AttachSpec
        self._recording = False
        self._grad = None
        self._after_backward_callback = []
        self._gradients = {}
        self._priority = None

    def attached_tensors(self):
        r"""Return attached tensor list from :meth:`attach`."""
        return [spec.tensor() for spec in self._attach_specs.values()]

    def attach(self, tensors: Iterable[Tensor], callbacks=None):
        r"""Instruct GradManager to track operations on tensors, so that gradients with respect
        to those tensors could be evaluated later.

        :meth:`attach` also accepts a list of callbacks, which will be called with the tensor and
        its gradient during :meth:`backward`. The signature of callbacks should look like:

            .. code-block::

                def callback(tensor: Tensor, grad: Tensor) -> Tensor:
                    ...
                    # returned grad is passed to subsequent callbacks
                    # and finally accumulated to the .grad attribute of tensor
                    return grad

        :meth:`attach` calls with overlapping tensors will result in their callbacks concatenated,
        independently for each tensor. For example,

            .. code-block::

                gm.attach([x, y], callbacks=[f])
                gm.attach([y], callbacks=[g])

        is equivalent to

            .. code-block::

                gm.attach([x], callbacks=[f])
                gm.attach([y], callbacks=[f, g])

        The effect of :meth:`attach` will persist across multiple uses of the GradManager. When
        reusing a GradManager, it is likely a mistake to call :meth:`attach` on the same set of
        tensors and callbacks repeatedly, which may grow the callback list indefinitely.

        .. note::

            When reusing a GradManager, it is sometimes desirable to attach temporary tensors each
            time, e.g. for computing gradients of inputs of a neural network. GradManager tries to
            accommodate such usages by holding weak references to attached tensors. Most of the
            times, this should be enough to prevent resource leak. Unfortunately, there are still
            some pitfalls left:

                - Callbacks should not hold strong references, directly or indirectly, to attached
                  tensors. Any strong reference, including those from callbacks, will prevent
                  garbage collection (even by the cycle collector!) of a attached tensor, until
                  the GradManager object is garbage collected.

            Please also note that GradManager might hold additional strong references to attached
            tensors when it is in use. This note only covers potential resource leaks across
            multiple uses of a GradManager, which is unrelated to whether resources is timely
            released within a single use.

        direct sums (or flatten-and-concatenate). :math:`y` and :math:`dy` are passed as the first
